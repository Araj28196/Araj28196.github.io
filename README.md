# Hyperledger Administrator/AI Developer

### objective

Skilled Software Developer with expertise in Blockchain technology(Hyperledger Fabric). Adept at integrating tools like Docker,
Kubernetes to build scalable solutions. Also Proficient in data science, machine learning models, and Devops tools. Quick learner
with strong problem-solving abilities and adaptability to new technologies. Committed to delivering high-quality work through
attention to detail and continuous learning

### Projects@ Work

#### Project Hyperledger - stage 1
- Successfully upgraded a finance blockchain project involving Hyperledger Fabric from version Legacy to 2.2.4 for dispute
management between Lumen and Verizon.
- completed a proof-of-concept (POC) on integrating Hyperledger Fabric with a private Interplanetary File System (IPFS) network
- took the initiative to integrate Hyperledger Explorer and Hyperledger Caliper into the project.
#### Project Hyperledger - stage 2
- Spearheaded the migration of the Hyperledger network from an on-premises VM-based Docker setup to Azure Kubernetes
Service (AKS).
- Implemented Azurefile share integration with AKS via a private endpoint, creating a storage class, persistent volumes (PVs), and
persistent volume claims (PVCs) for seamless data access within pods.
- Leveraged Sysbox to streamline the process of pushing chaincode Docker images to Azure Container Registry (ACR) and
deploying them directly from ACR, eliminating the need for a separate VM.
#### Project Hyperledger - stage 3
- Successfully added a new organization to the Hyperledger network on Azure, following the official Fabric samples for the "add
org" process.
- ensured seamless data synchronization between the new and old setups during the transition phase.
- Decommissioned the legacy on-premises setup after successfully migrating to the new Azure-based Hyperledger network.
- Working on integration of semantic kernal with hyperledger fabric network
#### Project Devops - HLF
- Leveraged tools such as Jenkins Declarative pipeline, Docker, and Kubernetes to automate the deployment of Fabric
components, including peers, orderers, and chaincode, while maintaining network integrity and security.
- Exhibited a proactive approach to learning and adapting to new DevOps tools and technologies relevant to Hyperledger Fabric,
enabling successful deployment and management of blockchain networks despite being at an intermediate level in the field

### Projects@ Work

#### Project Sentinel
- Developed a custom security camera system for a small distributor shop, leveraging an SBC (Single Board Computer) and a TPU
(Tensor Processing Unit) for advanced computer vision capabilities.
- Integrated the Frigate application to enable real-time object detection, currently focusing on training and refining detection
models like llama.
- Set up a dedicated server using an old laptop, installed Twingate to securely connect to the network from the internet, ensuring
remote access and management.
- Demonstrated hands-on experience in deploying and managing AI-driven surveillance solutions, with a focus on enhancing
security and operational efficiency.
